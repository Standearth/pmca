I order 400-700 Dollars worth of merchandise on Amazon every month. So I would hope that they would do everything they can to Keep striving and be more innovative in ways that they can be green and friendly to the climate and the Earth and equitable to the people that they employ and that they serve.,
When I lived San Francisco I thought that since Amazon was creating its own delivery fleet with brand new cargo vans they could’ve opted into an electric or hybrid solution to reduce emissions. Big missed opportunity. Now I live in a remote location on the Sonoma coast where I don’t have residential USPS delivery so Amazon deliveries are somewhat of a lifeline. Bottom line: I appreciate the service but want  Amazon to step up to their responsibility to the environment- they can surely afford to do it and doing so would go along way to retaining me as a customer.,
"What I would like to see change, is that every single piece that gets shipped be entirely wrapped with recycled paper products. Also, I would like to see appropriate boxing for goods shipped. Sometimes the boxes are way to big for the product inside.","Pamela, Alberta"
"I have been a frequent Amazon shopper for many years, but have shopped less recently due to Amazon's poor record on environmental concerns among  other failures  such as employee safety and well-being.I want Amazon to listen to our concerns.",
"Although there has been some improvement in Amazon's packaging, I have often received an item in a box ten times the size of the product, or more, with folded paper filler.","John, Florida"
"For the most part, I’m happy with Amazon Prime because I now live in a rural area with only art and antique shops or limited grocery shopping.  The closest clothing stores, large grocery stores and large hardware stores are in many directions about 40 minutes one way.  That’s a lot of gas use, time waste, wear and tear on my old car.  If Amazon is using Rivian vans, then delivery to my area is not only helpful, but",
With the amount that amazon dominates the shipping industry now any small change they make could have a big impact just based on how much of the market they control.,
There is so much extra packaging that is not needed. Also you could use far less plastic and more paper.,
I hate the unreliability–I never know whether things are being sent by Amazon delivery or USPS. And it makes a difference–both in the address I choose and also energy-wise.,"Sandra, Texas"
Like amazon enough to by stock 5 years ago.... but the amount of packaging and gas vehicles needs to change! NO MORE plastic mailing envelopes!,
Most of my friends have canceled their Amazon account because of its negative environmental practices convincing them to return will be impossible endless this changes. I will also cancel mine with what I know know and use my voice to convince others to do the same.,"Daniella, BC"
I think Amazon has been making a lot of positive moves as far as carbon-consciousness.  Putting climate-friendly tags on product listings and offering Amazon Day delivery for reducing shipping emissions are a great start.  Pushing even further and becoming a global leader in reducing carbon emissions would be even greater.,"Joseph, Texas"
"I do order from Amazon. Every time I do, I feel a pang because I can imagine how the warehouse activity, the packaging, the shipping and the delivery all contribute to carbon emissions and waste. Amazon has an obligation to mitigate climate disruption for its customers.",
I have requested on more than one occasion that Amazon stop shipping me items in those quilted plastic envelopes. They are not recyclable and they have paper quilted envelopes. I used to order nail polish but stopped because one tiny bottle came in a box big enough to hold 50.,"Linda, Ontario"
